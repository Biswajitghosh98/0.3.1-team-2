## HSV channels

HSV is cylindrical geometry, with hue, the angular dimension, starting at the red primary at 0째, passing through the green primary at 120째 and the blue primary at 240째, and then wrapping back to red at 360째. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the neutral, achromatic, or gray colors ranging, from top to bottom, white at lightness 1 (value 1) to black at lightness 0 (value 0). 

## Idea used 

We need to find the average of the H and V values which is further used in ``autoAdjustments.jl``to calculate the mapping of brightness using bright pixels. 

## br_ind() function

This function returns the summation of the values of H channel and V channel.

## Usage

include("b_idx.jl")
